🌦️ Weather App — Project Summary

Weather App is a simple and intuitive web application that lets users check current weather conditions and forecasts for any city around the world.

It’s built using modern web technologies and offers:

🔎 Searchable city weather

☀️🌧️ Current temperature, weather conditions, humidity, wind speed

📅 Optional forecast for upcoming days

📱 Responsive layout for any device

🌍 Clean and user-friendly interface

This project is a great example of how to consume weather APIs and build a real-time, interactive frontend experience.

🧠 How It Works

The user enters a city name in the search input.

The app sends a request to a weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap).

Weather data is fetched and displayed clearly on the UI.

Users can view temperature, conditions, and more — instantly.

🚀 Features

🌐 Real-time weather data by city name

📊 Displays temperature, humidity, weather icons

🧠 Built with a clean component structure

📦 Uses API integration for live data

📱 Fully responsive for desktop and mobile
